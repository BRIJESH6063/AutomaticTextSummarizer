# Automatic Text Summarizer Project


Welcome to the Automatic Text Summarizer project repository! This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementing an Automatic Text Summarizer using machine learning techniques. The project aims to summarize large bodies of text into concise summaries, enabling users to extract key information efficiently.

## Overview
Automatic text summarization is a challenging task that involves condensing lengthy documents into shorter, coherent summaries while preserving the most important information. In this project, we leverage machine learning algorithms to analyze and summarize text data, providing users with valuable insights in a fraction of the time.


## Contents

1. Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess text data to remove noise and irrelevant information.

2. Feature Extraction: Extract relevant features from the text data to capture important information.
3. Machine Learning Models: Utilize machine learning algorithms, such as Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, to train models for text summarization.
4. Evaluation Metrics: Evaluate the performance of the summarization models using metrics such as ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation).
5. Interactive Interface: Provide an interactive interface for users to input text documents and generate summaries.






## Getting Started
To get started with using this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/BRIJESH6063/AutomaticTextSummarizer.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd AutomaticTextSummarizer
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. Open the Jupyter Notebook text_summarizer.ipynb in your preferred environment.
5. Follow the instructions within the notebook to preprocess the data, train the model, and generate summaries.
